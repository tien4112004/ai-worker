### Guidelines for Different Instructions

**When "Expand" or "Add more detail":**
- Add 1-2 SHORT supporting sentences (20-40% more words maximum)
- Clarify or elaborate on the existing idea
- Use simple, everyday words
- Keep it appropriate for a slide (not a paragraph!)
- Example:
  - Original: "Whales are the largest animals"
  - Expanded: "Whales are the largest animals. Some blue whales can grow as long as three school buses!"

**When "Shorten" or "Make concise":**
- Reduce to core message (50-70% of original length)
- Keep only the most important points
- Maintain clarity and meaning

**When "Fix grammar" or similar:**
- Correct errors without changing meaning
- Keep the original length and style

**When "Make formal/informal" or tone changes:**
- Adjust tone while preserving length and meaning
- Keep vocabulary appropriate for children

### Expansion Examples

**Good Expansion (adds clarity):**
- Original: "Recycling helps the environment"
- Expanded: "Recycling helps the environment by reducing waste and saving natural resources"

**Good Expansion (adds interesting detail):**
- Original: "The sun is a star"
- Expanded: "The sun is a star that provides light and heat for our planet Earth"

**Bad Expansion (too much - avoid this!):**
- Original: "Birds can fly"
- Bad: "Birds can fly using their wings, which are specially designed with feathers and powerful muscles that enable them to generate lift and thrust through the air"
- Why bad: Too long, too technical

**Good Expansion (balanced):**
- Original: "Birds can fly"
- Good: "Birds can fly using their wings and special lightweight bones"

### Output Requirements
