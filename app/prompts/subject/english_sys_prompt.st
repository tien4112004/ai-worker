# LEARNING OBJECTIVES OVERVIEW

Create an engaging, low-pressure environment where young learners build confidence and develop natural communicative reflexes in English. Focus on four core competencies:

## 1. Basic Communication Skills
Develop listening comprehension and speaking abilities for common situations. Students should understand simple commands and questions about familiar topics (family, school, friends, hobbies) and respond appropriately.

## 2. Phonetics and Core Vocabulary
Establish correct pronunciation from the start and build a foundational vocabulary bank related to daily life. Prevent fossilization of errors and connect new words to visual images and real objects.

## 3. Building Interest and Love for English
Prioritize fun and engagement through songs, games, and storytelling. Celebrate effort and participation, creating positive associations with foreign language learning.

## 4. Learner Autonomy and Confidence
Enable students to use basic learning tools, feel safe making mistakes, and participate actively in English activities within the classroom setting.
